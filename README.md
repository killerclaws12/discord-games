# Discord Games BETA
### **NOTE**:
This is my first npm package, used for testing with my friends. Feel free to continue reading if you want to use it for yourself.

<br>

If you have any errors or issues, please update the package by doing `npm i discord-games` and read the contents in the usage section to make sure you have coded it correctly  

# What is this ?
This is a package used to enable an game event inside a **Discord Voice Channel**, like **YouTube Watch Togther**, **Chess**, **Word Tile**, and much more.

# How does this work ?
This works by creating an invite to a voice channel of your will in such a way that is makes game playable in that specific voice channel.

# Installation
```
npm i discord-games
```

# Usage

- Constructor:
```js
const DiscordGame = require('discord-games');
const game = new DiscordGame(params);
```
- Params:
```js
/**
 * (YourDiscordBotToken, NameOfTheGame, MaximumDuration, {Options})
 */

const game = new DiscordGame('Token', 'chess', 2, {neverExpire: false});

/**
 * "Token" is the Discord Client which you are using in your code
 * "chess" is the name of the game which you wanted to play
 * "2" is the Maximum Duration of the game event in hours
 * 
 * "neverExpire" is an optional parameter by which you can choose wheater you want your invite link to get expired or not
 * Normally it will get expired after the "MaximumDuration" but by setting the parameter to true, the link will not expire on its own
 */
```
### NOTE: The Maximum Duration can only be more than 0

- Function: 
```js
game.play(vc).then(result => console.log(result));

// "vc" is the Discord Voice channel which you want to play the game in.
```
- Result:
```js
{
    code : String // Code of the invite link
    inviteLink : String // The invite link itself
    createdAt : Date // The time when the invite was created
    validTill : Date | String // The time at which the invite gets expired, if 'neverExpire' is set as 'true' you will get a string

    guild :
    {
        ID : String // ID of the server in which the invite has been made
        name : String // Name of the server in which the invite has been made
    },

    channel :
    {
        ID : String // ID of the channel to which the invite has been made
        name : String // Name of the channel to which the invite has been made
    },

    inviter : 
    {
        ID : String // ID of the user who made the invite (i.e, The Bot's ID which has been used to do the task)
        name : String // Name of the user who made the invite (i.e, The Bot's Name which has been used to do the task)
    },

    app :
    {
        ID : String // ID of the game
        name : String // Name of the game
        description : String // A short description of the game
        summary : String // A summary of the game
        maxMembers : String // Maximum number of members the game allows
    }
}
```


# Example Code (for one game)

```js
const Discord = require('discord.js');
const DiscordGame = require('discord-games');

const client = new Discord.Client();
const YouTube = new DiscordGame('Token', 'youtube', 2);

client.on('messageCreate', (message) =>
{
    if (message.content === 'play')
    {    
        const VoiceChannel = message.member.voice.channel;  // The voice channel in which the event is gonna occur

        YouTube.play(VoiceChannel).then(result => message.channel.send(result.inviteLink));
    }
});

client.login('Token');
```

## What should I do if I want to play other games ?
Just replace **name of the game** which is the second parameter of constructor (i.e, `new DiscordGame()`) with any of the available games

To get the list of the **available games** you can do
```js
const DiscordGame = require('discord-games');
const game = new DiscordGame();

console.log(game.gameNames()); // This will print all the available games in your console !
```
### Output:
```
youtube
poker
betrayal
fishing
chess
letterLeague
wordSnack
awkword
doodleCrew
spellCast
checkers
sketchHeads
blazing8s
landIO
puttParty
bobbleLeague
askAway
kwim    // Game name for "Know What I Meme !"
```
